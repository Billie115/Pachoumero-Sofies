            <h1>Things about me!</h1>
            <p>
                If i'm being honest, i like to do many things, but in reality i stick to a few things. First and foremost, <b>I enjoy playing games</b>.
                When I play solo, I prefer <b>Survival</b>, <b>Technology</b> and <b>Automation </b> games. When i have company to play with i don't mind the genre.
                When I'm not playing games, i usually just doom scroll in Instagram or Youtube shorts, i know, prety depressing. But in the rare case i'm
                not wasting my time on reels and shorts, I enjoy <b>fishing</b> and <b>driving</b> around. Yeah, somehow I, the one that stays on his house all day long
                also enjoys going to Mother Nature, quite <i><b>Paradoxical</b></i>. I study <b>Computer Science</b> in <i><b><a href="https://www.cs.duth.gr/" title="Check out my University's Site" target="_blank">DUTH</a></b></i> (Democritus University of Thrace).
                I'm in my <b>4th</b> and <b><u>final</u></b> year. I still haven't done my thesis, but thats the whole reason i started learning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank">HTML</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS#:~:text=Cascading%20Style%20Sheets%20(CSS)%20is,Web%2C%20alongside%20HTML%20and%20JavaScript." target="_blank">CSS</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank">Javascript</a>,
                that's because I to make a Web App as the main topic, I haven't really given much thought to it, but what i'm sure about is that it's
                going to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning" target="_blank"><b>Machine Learning</b></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis"target="_blank"><b>Data Analysis</b></a> as it's main gimmick.

            <h3>My Favourite Game</h3>
            <img src="Images/Minecraft Picture.jpg" height="250">
            <p>These are some of the games I enjoy playing, I know, some are... worse than others, but overall a solid choice for someone like me
                who spents an <b><i>Astronomical</i></b> amount of time inside. From all the games in the list, my personal <b>G.O.A.T</b> is modded Minecraft.
                 I believe there aren't many games, other than terraria, that can reach the level of additional <u>content</u> and <u>depth</u> that mods in minecraft add.

            <h1>Greg Tech</h1>
            <p><b>GregTech</b>… my favorite mod in Minecraft. It's not just about getting to the endgame or rushing through tiers—it's about the journey itself.
                 Every step forward feels earned, from the first time you manage to smelt something without burning through your scarce resources, 
                 to the moment you finally automate a process that used to take ages by hand. <b>GregTech</b> teaches <u>patience</u>, <u>planning</u>, and <u>problem-solving</u>, 
                 and that's exactly what makes it so special. <b><u>The mod isn't about the destination, but about the way there</u></b> - each challenge shaping the 
                 experience and making the progress feel more meaningful than any quick win ever could.</p>

            <h1>Projects I've worked on?</h1>
            <p>
                Well, that's a tough question for me to answer... The truth is, <i><u><b>even though i am a CS student, I don't have anything to prove my knowledge.</b></u></i>
                 What I mean by that is that, my <u>dumb ass</u> didn't bother to do anything. The only projects i've worked on are:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>a trial website. Meaning a website that I applied my HTML knowledge when I was learning it.</li>
                <li>This website ;)</li>
                <li>And a simple horror game I made on godot, from scratch with my assets. Yeah, it took more time to draw, than to code lol.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><u>That's all for now.</u></p>
